The Reserve Bank bought more than R11bn in government debt securities in April as part of a bond-buying programme to boost liquidity in financial markets that are reeling from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The central bank, which announced its plan on the eve of the imposition of the 21-day lockdown, upped its holdings to just more than R20.6bn from R9.2bn in March, according to data released on Friday. The overall market is estimated to be more than R2-trillion. The Bank had bought R1bn in March, though it only announced it was stepping up its efforts to inject liquidity into local financial markets on the 25th of that month. The SA market had been showing signs of stress amid the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis, seeing investors scrambling for cash and fleeing to safe-haven assets. These measures included the announcement that the Bank would begin buying government bonds in the secondary market — from banks and asset managers — after buyers for government bonds dried up and 10-year yields skyrocketed to records above 12%, from less than 9% in February. The Bank has made clear that the action was about providing liquidity and reducing market volatility, not supporting bond prices. “Its continual involvement will improve market function, though it’s critical to point out that in the long run this can only be sustained if a credible budget and economic reforms are put on the table,” said Sasfin Wealth fixed-income trader Alvin Chawasema. In morning trade on Friday, the local R2030 had strengthened, with its yield falling 10 basis points to 9.34%. Bond yields move inversely to bond prices. The rand was 0.73% firmer at R18.46/$, with global markets finding support from hopes of easing US-China trade tension.
