Flooring company Accéntuate is eyeing commercial opportunities in the health and education sector as it battles with a weak  economy it describes as the worst in recent memory. The group’s vinyl flooring manufacturer, FloorworX, has been operating as an essential service during the Covid-19 lockdown, and is looking for new opportunities, the group said. As vinyl flooring is nonporous it is  considered a hygienic option. Accéntuate manufactures vinyl flooring and  has water treatment and chemicals interests. It is headed by CEO Fred Platt, who has resigned with effect from end-August. The group says a slowdown in infrastructure spending and SA’s generally weak economy weighed on it during its six months to end-December, when revenue slumped 21.5% to R94.5m. In February 2019 the group  announced the disposal of flooring business Pentafloor for about R13m. The group narrowed its loss for the period by about 29% to R11.4m, saying its cost-reduction measures are bearing fruit, although it did not go into details. Accéntuate had a market capitalisation of R24m as of Monday morning, and its share price is little traded but volatile, having risen 325% so far in 2020. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
