Nesi Chetty from Stanlib chose Equites Property Fund as his stock pick of the day. “The one sector that we have favoured in property is logistics, we like a company called Equites. It reported results on Tuesday and I think in this market you are either going to be in cash or you are going to be in something defensive.”
