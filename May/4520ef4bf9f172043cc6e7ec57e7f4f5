Waldo du Plessis from Nitrogen Fund Managers chose Liberty as his stock pick of the day. “I’m going to go with Liberty tonight, I think the CEO has done a good job of turning the business around before Covid-19, it’s priced lower than the peer group and I think Liberty is looking attractive at these levels.”
