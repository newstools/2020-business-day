The JSE started the week with a third consecutive session of losses on Monday, suffering its biggest intraday drop since June 2016 as the rise in new cases of the coronavirus outside China sparked global risk-off trade. New cases of the virus have been reported in South Korea, Italy and Iran, fuelling fears that the outbreak may turn into a global pandemic. China has since lifted its movement restrictions for locals as the number of new cases decreases, Reuters reported. “Investors have sold out of shares for five Fridays in a row because they were unwilling to hold on over the weekend in the likelihood of bad news about the coronavirus. They were correct to do so this weekend. The number of coronavirus cases has shot up to 763, with all flights to the city of Daegu cancelled,” said London Capital Group head of research Jasper Lawler.
