Restaurant group Spur said on Friday it expected interim profit for its half-year to end-December to rise by about a third, having reversed a R10.8m credit-loss provision related to former BEE partner Grand Parade Investments (GPI). Headline earnings per share for the period are expected to rise by between 32% and 37% compared with the prior period’s 92.34c, Spur said. In July, GPI said it would dispose of its 10% stake in Spur, which would be repurchased by Spur for R260.4m. In 2014 Spur sold 10.8-million of its shares to GPI for R294.7. In morning trade on Friday Spur’s share price was unchanged at R24.66, having risen 13.07% over the past 12 months. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
