The demand for industrial space here has triggered phase two development. Dube TradeZone 2: now open for applications To meet demand for business real estate immediately adjacent to King Shaka International Airport, Dube TradePort Corporation, a public entity of the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government and tasked with the development of the precinct, is set to expand its trade zone operations.

These fully serviced, levelled sites range in size from 3,000m² to 57,000m² with utilities provided to boundary lines. Dube TradeZone 2 will develop a pharmaceutical cluster, revolving around production and distribution, as well as the supply of common utilities and services for key industries.
