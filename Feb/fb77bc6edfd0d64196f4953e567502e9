The JSE was firmer on Tuesday morning, taking its lead from stronger US and Asian markets, with banks faring best. US markets continue to push higher, boosted recently by upbeat corporate updates, helping offset concerns over the coronavirus.

Asian markets rallied as China’s factories re-opened after an extended Lunar New Year, though some factories are struggling to re-open as viral outbreak persists. There were 2,478 new confirmed cases on the mainland by Monday, down from 3,062 the previous day, bringing the total to more than 43,000. It was the second time in two weeks that authorities recorded a daily drop in new cases, offering a hint of hope the epidemic is peaking, reported Reuters.
