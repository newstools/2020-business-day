Mark du Toit from Oyster Catcher Investments chose British American Tobacco (BAT) as his stock pick of the day and Ricus Reeders from PSG Wealth chose AECI. Du Toit said: “British American Tobacco, so it’s a stock that came under huge pressure about two years ago. A lot of focus in America from the FDA [Food & Drug Administration] on cigarettes and the health impact.” Reeders said: “I think even before the coronavirus, AECI, which is my stock pick, was undervalued and I don’t think it should be.”
