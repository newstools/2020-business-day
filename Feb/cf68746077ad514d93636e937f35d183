Q: I am a single mother of two, nearing 60 and, for varying reasons, haven’t saved enough for my retirement. I am still working (for myself) and have some savings. But I need more. Any ideas how I can add to my savings? — W Martin via e-mail A: Ricardo Teixeira, Certified Financial Planner® professional at BDO Wealth Advisers, answers: The definition of retirement is different for everyone. The traditional meaning is associated with one stopping work and living a life of leisure. However, the reality is far from that. Most “retirees” continue to remain engaged and active after formal retirement age and generally only slow down when they choose to. Determining how long you plan to work for yourself, as you now are, is a key date in your financial planning and a financial planner can help you calculate how much money you are likely to need to fund your retirement. The gap between how much you have and how much you may need, is the savings gap you’re looking to fill with any one or a combination of these strategies: Investing and saving are actions that are founded on good habits and discipline. Getting started is difficult. You are on the right path by asking the question you have. Next is to act. * Send your questions to money@arena.africa
