Power utility Eskom said on Friday stage two load-shedding had been extended until 6am on Sunday morning, after the breakdown of two additional units. While the three broken generation units that prompted load-shedding from Thursday are expected to return to service on Friday, load-shedding needed to be extended to replenish reserves for next week. Eskom also said the system remains unpredictable and constrained, and there was a chance of increased load-shedding over the next 18 months. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
