David Shapiro from Sasfin Securities chose China ETF as his stock pick of the day and Wayne McCurrie from FNB Wealth & Investments chose Ping An. Shapiro said: “I still like China and I still like the China fund here in SA. I think that if you’re not exposed to it’s something that you can diversify, and that’s the Chinese ETF.” McCurrie said: “My stock is similar, I’m going for Ping An, and I know their results came out and they weren’t particularly good, they were a little bit disappointing in a couple of areas, but the share price still looks attractively valued in relation to the fundamentals.”
