David Shapiro from Sasfin Securities chose Next Era as his stock pick of the day and Martin Smith from Anchor chose MTN. Shapiro said: “My offshore pick, because of the climate issues that we’re having at the moment, is a company called Next Era ... a clean air company.” Smith said: “I think one that’s offering some value on the JSE is MTN. I think fundamentally the stock is looking incredibly cheap and should probably be around R70.”
