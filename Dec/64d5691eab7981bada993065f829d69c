David Shapiro from Sasfin Securities chose MSCI World Index as his stock pick of the day and Martin Smith from Anchor Capital chose KAP Industrial. Shapiro said: “I reckon you should just buy the MSCI World index. Things are going to get better next year and I think we will see global markets pick up, please understand that this is against the backdrop of zero interest rates for a number of years to come.” Smith said: “I’m quite optimistic for 2021, my share pick would be KAP. They had quite a good share update yesterday, they’re in the mid-cap space.”
