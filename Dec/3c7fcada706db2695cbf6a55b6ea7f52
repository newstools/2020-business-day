Alex Duys from Umthombo Wealth chose Lewis as his stock pick of the day and Nick Crail from Ashburton Investments chose Naspers. Duys said: “I’m looking at SA Inc and there are quite a few companies that are more resilient and one of those whose results we saw last week is Lewis.” Crail said: “I’m going for the old solid fan favourite, Naspers. You’ve seen a bit of a rotation trade, out of growth into value during the month.”
