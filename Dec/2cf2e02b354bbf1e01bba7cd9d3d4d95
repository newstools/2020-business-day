Makwe Masilela from Makwe Fund Managers chose Vukile Property Fund as his stock pick of the day. “My stock is property, especially the likes of Vukile. Yes, they have a negative return of equity of 2%, their dividend yield is at 6%, forward PE [price-earnings ratio] stands at 7%, but if you look at their portfolio and where they’re positioned and it’s not surprising that their collection rate is standing at almost 95%.”
