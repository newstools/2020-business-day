Nick Crail from Ashburton Investments chose British American Tobacco (BAT) as his stock pick of the day and Siboniso Nxumalo from Old Mutual Investments chose FirstRand. Crail said: “I would be tempted with British American Tobacco, I suppose it fits into a that rand-hedge theme that I was discussing a little bit earlier. And it really comes down to the stock just being unloved in the market.” Nxumalo said: “I’m going with FirstRand ... we think that if [banks] are going harvest data and do it well, they’re going to do exceptionally well.”
