Mark du Toit from OysterCatcher Investments chose Absa as his stock pick of the day and Jean Pierre Verster from Protea Capital Management chose Amgen. Du Toit said: “I’m going with Absa, they came out with a very detailed trading update which bodes well for building confidence in the sector. We saw their credit-loss ratio and they put through a large management overlay provision in the half year results and I think we will continue to see their credit-loss ratio reducing over the next three years.” Verster said: “My stock is Amgen; it’s a US-listed biotech company that makes a biotech different from a pharma company. Their drugs are far more difficult to copy. They focus on certain drugs for arthritis, cancer, asthma and a few others.”
