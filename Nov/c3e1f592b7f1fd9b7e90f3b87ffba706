The JSE was weaker on Thursday, with its global peers mixed as the Covid-19 pandemic remains in focus with cases rising in some parts of the world. This week, France and Italy both recorded the highest daily coronavirus death tolls since April, while the Paris region is close to exhausting its ICU capacity. In Germany, the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care has reached a new record. In the US, Covid-19 cases are hitting new records with New York tightening restrictions overnight. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has threatened to tighten restrictions further if cases continue to climb. As progress on the vaccine front boosted stock markets this week, investors are cautious as important details are yet to be made clear. “The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine news is a double-edged sword for Europe and the US, as health officials worry that vaccines hopes will lead to less social discipline among their respective populations. Sadly, things are likely to get worse before they get better,” said Oanda senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley.
