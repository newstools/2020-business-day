Ricus Reeders from PSG Wealth Sandton chose Daikin Industries as his stock pick of the day and Chantal Marx from FNB Wealth & Investments chose Impala Platinum. Reeders said: “I’m going for Daikin, it’s a Japanese company which is the biggest or second-biggest maker of air conditioning units. There has been an incredible demand for air conditioning as people stay at home, and especially in Japan.” Marx said: “I’m going for Impala Platinum.... Platinum is actually geared towards high mobility, which means it should do well in the event of a normalisation of economic activity, which a vaccine will eventually bring us.”
