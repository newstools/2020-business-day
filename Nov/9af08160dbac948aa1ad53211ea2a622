Nick Crail from Ashburton Investments chose Sibanye-Stillwater as his stock pick of the day. “It’s a bit of a shot in the dark at the moment but certainly a sector that I think is really underperformed in the last two months, and I still think with this uncertainty has some legs to it, and that’s gold.”
