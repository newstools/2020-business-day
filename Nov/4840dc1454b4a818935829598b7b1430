The JSE faces  muted Asian markets on Tuesday morning, amid positive vaccine news, but also rising Covid-19 numbers in the US. Sentiment was boosted on Monday by news that AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, produced in conjunction with Oxford University, was up to 90% efficacious. This follows announcements of positive results by both the candidate put forward by BioNtech and Pfizer, as well as one by Moderna. European stocks were under pressure on Monday, however, not withstanding the AstraZeneca news, suggesting that a lot of positive vaccine-related news is now in the price, National Australia Bank analyst David de Garis said in a note. “There was also not much support from news that social-distancing restrictions will be eased in time for the Christmas holiday period,” De Garis said.
