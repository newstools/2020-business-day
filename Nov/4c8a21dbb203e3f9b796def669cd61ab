Comair, the operator of kulula.com and British Airways in SA that is emerging from business rescue, on Monday announced the resignation of CEO Wrenelle Stander. The company, due to resume flights on Tuesday, said Glenn Orsmond, a former joint-CEO with Stander before the group ditched that model in 2019, was the new CEO. Comair has also appointed Kirsten King as CFO. Stander’s resignation is effective from Monday. In a note to Comair employees, which Business Day has seen, Stander said: “It has truly been a pleasure to work with you over the last two years and to lead you as the CEO during one of the most difficult times in Comair's 74-year history.” In the note she said the consortium of investors, which has made an offer to buy the listed airline operator, had signalled that it would bring a new executive team. “I would like to wish the new team well and hope that under their leadership Comair will grow from strength to strength,” she said. “I also wish to thank the joint business rescue practitioners, Shaun Collyer and Richard Ferguson for their co-operation and collaboration over the past seven months”. Stander has held the positions of deputy CEO of the SA Civil Aviation Authority, MD of the Air Traffic and Navigation Service Company and MD of Sasol Gas, where she was credited for ensuring the completion of the Mozambique pipeline expansion project. “The board would like to thank Ms Stander for her invaluable contribution to the company over the past two years and especially for the hard work, commitment and outstanding leadership she provided during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic and business rescue process. The directors and the business rescue practitioners wish her every success in her new endeavours,” Comair said in a statement. njobenis@businesslive.co.za
