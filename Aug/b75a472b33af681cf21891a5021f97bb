Diversified miner Exxaro, which supplies coal to Eskom, has reported it fared well amid SA's lockdown due to record coal exports and a weaker rand. Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) are expected to rise by as much as 28% to R4.078bn in the group's half year to end-June, when it operated as an essential service. Ebitda is a measure of the underlying operational performance of a company, excluding items such as finance costs. Coal prices were under pressure in dollar terms, though a weaker rand benefited the group. Headline earnings per share is expected to fall by 18%-34% from the prior period's R17.30. This was largely due to the effect of Exxaro accounting for the non-controlling interest of its black empowerment scheme from November. In morning trade on Tuesday Exxaro's share was up 3.95% to R144.18, on track for its best one-day performance in just over a month. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
