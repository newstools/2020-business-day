The share of price of consumer internet group Prosus was on track for its worst day in almost five months on Friday, after the White House moved to restrict US companies from doing business with Tencent. In morning trade Naspers was down 4.54% to R3,077, while Prosus was down 5.9% to R1,640 â€” on track for its worst day since March 16. This wiped out about R230bn in shareholder value from the Naspers stable. Naspers, via Prosus, is the largest single shareholder in Tencent, holding 31.2% of the WeChat owner. US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order barring US companies from making financial transactions with Tencent, the owner of WeChat, and ByteDance, the owner of the TikTok app. The White House gave US companies 45 days, citing national security concerns. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
