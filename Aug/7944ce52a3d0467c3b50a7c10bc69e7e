The AutoTrader website reported a record 401-million online searches for used cars in the past 12 months, a 38.5% year-on-year growth. This is according to AutoTrader’s  “2020 Car Industry Report”, which reveals detailed trends and buying patterns in SA’s pre-owned car market. It is  noted in the report that the average selling price of used cars on the website increased to R289,312 in the 12 months to June. This was a 3% increase over the year before, and resulted from increases in average used-car prices in February and March. Another key finding was that during Covid-19 lockdown levels 5 and 4, consumers became more price conscious, says George Mienie, AutoTrader CEO. During the lockdown period, searches shifted to include under R50,000 as one of the top five most searched price ranges, he said. This  normalised as restrictions were lifted and the market operated under level 3 lockdown. The under R200,000 price range continues to be the most searched  price point for used-car shoppers. According to the report, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused used-vehicle sales to plummet 11.9% in the past year, having been on track for a 9% increase. Mienie stressed the importance of digital retailing to the future success of car dealers, as  social distancing has caused car buyers to limit visits to physical dealerships. The 48-page report provides insight into which makes, models and  variants (including trim levels and colours) are important to car-buying consumers.
