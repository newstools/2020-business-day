Robert Towell from Sasfin Securities chose Medtronic as his stock pick of the day. “I’m choosing Medtronic. It’s a medical suppliers business overseas that does pacemakers, and hip and knee replacements. They also do hi-tech medical equipment and we saw that a lot of these companies dropped off substantially during Covid.”
