Waldo du Plessis from Nitrogen Fund Managers chose Naspers as his stock pick of the day. “I’m going to go with Naspers, Tencent results were out this week which were a resounding beat on market expectations, but Tencent has this overhang of this executive order that [US President Donald] Trump has signed in he which will ban transactions with WeChat, and that could flow out into Tencent’s expansion plans.”
