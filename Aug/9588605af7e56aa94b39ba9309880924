Independent analyst Chris Gilmour chose Afrimat as his stock pick of the day and Nesan Nair from Sasfin Securities chose Microsoft. Gilmour said: “It’s going to be Afrimat again. It’s an absolute no-brainer as far as I’m concerned ... you’re getting this stock for a song.” Nair said: “I’m going with Microsoft, I can’t stop myself from [picking] the tech companies, it’s front page news every day and I’m just riding with this wave until I crash.”
