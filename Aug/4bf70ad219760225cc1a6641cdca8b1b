Independent analyst Chris Gilmour chose Afrimat as his stock pick of the day and Devin Shutte from The Robert Group chose Cisco. Gilmour said: “I’m sticking with the stock pick I’ve had for the past two or three weeks and that’s Afrimat. I think the fundamentals are still very much in place if you look at the iron-ore price that keeps on rising.” Shutte said: “I’m going for a traditionally hardware provider called Cisco Systems.”
