The JSE fell on Thursday morning, with Asian markets remaining under pressure, as the coronavirus outbreak intensified and fuelled additional concern over the potential economic fallout. The World Health Organisation (WHO) is expected to meet for an emergency meeting on Thursday to consider its next steps for containing the virus. Markets will be closely watching the outcome of this meeting. Asian stocks were under pressure as economists reconsidered China’s growth prospects for the first quarter. Millions of people in the world’s second-largest economy are already facing travel restrictions. “Asian markets have fallen to seven-week lows, as concerns over the coronavirus elevate once again,” said Rand Merchant Bank analyst Siobhan Redford. The WHO has called a meeting of its emergency committee on Thursday to discuss whether they need to issue a global alert over the virus as the death toll continued to rise sharply, now standing at 170 people, said Redford. “Should the WHO issue such an alert, the risk-off environment that has been dominating global trade is likely to intensify”, he said.
