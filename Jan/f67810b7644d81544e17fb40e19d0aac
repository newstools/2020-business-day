The JSE was fairly subdued on Thursday morning and still on track for a weekly loss. Global markets recovered as fears related to the tension between the US and Iran eased. US President Donald Trump's comments that the US would not retaliate through military action against Iran calmed global markets.

Helping matters is that the missile strikes from yesterday only did minor damage to the US bases and there was no loss of life, ”  fund manager Vestact said in a note.
