The JSE was on track for its second weekly loss on Friday morning as concern about the spread of the coronavirus curbed investor appetite for riskier assets. The virus has been the dominant theme on the markets this week. Numerous countries have closed their borders or suspended flights to China amid concern that the outbreak will damage economic activity in the world’s second-largest economy. The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday declared that the virus constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, though it has stopped short of recommending limiting trade or travel, National Australia Bank analyst Ray Attrill said in a note. That announcement did not add additional downward pressure on either US equities or bonds, he said. Earlier, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 0.52%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 added 0.99% and the Shanghai Composite was closed. At 10.45am, the JSE all share was down 0.31% to 56,414.7 points and the top 40 had lost 0.3%. The local bourse has shed 1.48% so far this week. Banks were down 0.96% and gold miners 1.08%. Embattled sugar producer Tongaat Hulett said on Friday that its revenue decreased by 1.5% to R8.085bn in the six months to end-September. The group said the JSE had approved its request for the suspension of its shares to be lifted on February 3. Sasol's share price dropped 6.51% to R239.81 after the company said on Friday that headline earnings per share (HEPS) are expected to decline by between 69% and 79% to between R4.79 and R7.11 in the six months to end-December 2019.
