David Shapiro from Sasfin Securities chose Alphabet as his stock pick of the day and Wayne McCurrie from FNB Wealth & Investments chose Mondi. Shapiro said: “If I had to choose a pick in the FANG [Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Google] grouping, I would say probably Alphabet.” McCurrie said: “With the e-commerce company’s needing boxes, you need a stalwart like Mondi to produce the boxes for them to use for shipping.”
