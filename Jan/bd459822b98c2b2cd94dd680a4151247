Imtiaz Suliman from Sentio Capital chose Ulta Beauty as his stock pick of the day. “I’m going with Ulta Beauty. It’s a US-listed retail company.

They also sell a large range of perfumes, and health and beauty care products.” Listen to the full audio here: Subscribe: iono.fm | Spotify | Apple Podcasts | Pocket Casts | Player.fm
