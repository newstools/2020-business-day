The JSE will get little direction from Asian markets on Wednesday morning, with stocks showing little reaction to an emergency 50 basis point rate cut from the US Federal Reserve on Tuesday. Markets had largely priced in the cut, analysts said, while concern over the economic effects of the coronavirus persist. Central banks could not force people into shopping malls or into planes, said AxiCorp chief market strategist Stephen Innes in a note, adding that there was debate about the merit of the rate cut. “But from my perspective, the swift and decisive move was a necessary measure to support the equity markets which were entering a death spiral and demanded an urgent response,” Innes said. In morning trade on Wednesday the Shanghai Composite was flat, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng had gained 0.12%. Tencent, which influences the JSE via major shareholder Naspers, had fallen 0.15%. Gold was little changed at $1,641.59/oz while platinum had added 1.35% to $887.73/oz. Brent crude was 1.84% higher at $52.64 a barrel. The rand was 0.36% firmer at R15.35/$.
