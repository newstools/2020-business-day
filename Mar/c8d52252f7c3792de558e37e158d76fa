How long can the vicious oil-price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia last? If history is any guide, the battle will be a long one. Riyadh has waged four price wars, including the current one, over the past 35 years. All of them lasted at least a year, and prices plunged at least 50%. This time may be different, of course — there’s never been a demand shock so great at the same time as the supply shock. But the last wars are at least a guide to the pain thresholds of policymakers. Here is how they played out: In November, Riyadh moved to flood the market. Oil plunged from $31 a barrel to $9.75 in six months. The peace didn’t come until December 1986. Oil fell from about $20 a barrel to less than $10, and the peace didn’t arrive until April 1999. The peace didn’t come until September 2016: Riyadh made a U-turn and Russia joined the cuts. This time, the battle has been more brutal from the start, with prices crashing more than 35% in days. In past wars, prices tumbled slowly, over a period of months. Riyadh’s new shock-and-awe tactics may just shorten the fight by inflicting so much pain, so quickly, that everyone has to come to the table sooner. Bloomberg
