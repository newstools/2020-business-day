Chantal Marx from FNB wealth And Investments chose Shoprite as her stock pick and Ricus Reeders from PSG Wealth Sandton chose Bidvest. Marx said: “I like the SA food retail space at the moment. I specifically like Spar and Shoprite. Shoprite is my pick for tonight; I think that this is a stock that does well in terms of gaining market share when times are tough.” Reeders said: “Bidvest came out with numbers and this price goes below R170 because there’s a market shock. It’s going to go low so there’s your stop-loss in place, but considering the results it’s a story I like.” Or listen to the full audio: Subscribe: iono.fm | Apple Podcasts | Pocket Casts | Player.fm
