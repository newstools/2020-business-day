Taste Holdings, which is shifting its focus from fast foods to luxury goods, is  liquidating the subsidiary that holds the licence for Domino’s SA after failing to find a buyer for the pizza chain. A deal could not be concluded on terms acceptable to the parties during talks with several parties, and Domino’s Pizza International is not providing additional financial support, the group said on Monday. Due to the voluntary liquidation, the group had written off intercompany loans to the value of  R450m. Taste said in November it was unable to expand its network of chains sufficiently to reach its profit targets and intends to sell its fast-foods businesses. It has since sold its Starbucks licence as well as Maxi’s and The Fish & Chips Co. Taste intends becoming a luxury retail group. “The luxury division is not impacted by these liquidations and will continue with its strategy as a focused luxury retail business consisting of NWJ, Arthur Kaplan and World’s Finest Watches,” the group said. “The banking facilities of the luxury division are unaffected by these developments,” the statement reads. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
