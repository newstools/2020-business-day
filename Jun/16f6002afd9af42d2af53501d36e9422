Wealth and asset manager Peregrine Holdings said on Wednesday it expected profits to fall as much as 30% in its year to end-March, partially due to the effects of disposals that boosted its results in the prior financial year. Headline earnings per share for the year to end-March will fall between 25% and 30% from the prior periodâ€™s 210.8c, the group said in a trading update. The prior period had included R77m in earnings for its brokering and structuring business, sold in October 2018, and a one-time performance fee of R58m arising from a previous disposal of a property. In morning trade on Wednesday, Peregrine's share price was down 2.16% to R18.98, having risen 0.32% so far in 2020. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
