David Shapiro from Sasfin Securities chose Lindt & Sprüngli  as his stock pick of the day and Wayne McCurrie from FNB Wealth & Investments chose Transaction Capital. Shapiro said: “You have to buy chocolate, if you are going to go into Europe, buy chocolate. I was looking at a Swiss company called Lindt & Sprüngli, it’s a great company.” McCurrie said: “I’m going back to a favourite of mine, I think Transaction Capital, they haven’t fallen as much as other companies but are still below R20 a share and we all know that for whatever reasons, the taxi industry is back in full swing. I think they will do quite well ... probably better than any other average company.” Or listen to the full audio: Subscribe: iono.fm | Apple Podcasts | Pocket Casts | Player.fm
