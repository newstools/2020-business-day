Drikus Combrinck from Capicraft chose MSCI EAFE exchange traded fund (ETF) as his stock pick of the day and Bright Khumalo from Vestact chose Lemonade.

This is the EAFE value index, which dropped in March to levels last seen in 2005 and has recovered about half of its losses in the meantime.

An interesting company with a disruptive model with how they do insurance.” Or listen to the full audio: Subscribe: iono.fm | Apple Podcasts | Pocket Casts | Player.fm
