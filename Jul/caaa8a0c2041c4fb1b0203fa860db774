Kwame Antwi from KOA Capital chose SA bonds as his stock pick of the day. “We want to keep our powder dry, we think there will be a better opportunity, particularly because we already started the downturn cautiously. I don’t think we’re about to change tack now because the risk to get it wrong is is much higher at current level.”
