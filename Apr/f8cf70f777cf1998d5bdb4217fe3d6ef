The JSE’s two-day winning streak is under threat on Wednesday, with Asian markets mixed as investors eye declining Covid-19 numbers in some hard-hit areas, and volatility in the oil price. Italy, Spain and New York have all reported progress in containing the pandemic, and this has helped the rand to recover from record lows earlier in the week. US markets, however, came under pressure late on Tuesday, with the focus on an upcoming Organisation for the Oil-Producing Countries (Opec) meeting on Thursday, when it is hoped a production deal can be struck with Russia. Locally, there is speculation that SA’s 21-day lockdown could be extended, said Peregrine Treasury Solutions executive director Bianca Botes.
