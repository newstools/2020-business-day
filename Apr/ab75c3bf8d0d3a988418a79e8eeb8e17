The JSE could be under pressure on Friday morning, as investors digest dire economic data out of the eurozone, and the failure of the drug remdesivir in a clinical trial. Markets had been boosted by reports that remdesivir had helped Covid-19 patients with severe symptoms recently, however, the Financial Times has reported that the drug “flopped” in its first clinical trial. Markets were also digesting a fall in the eurozone purchasing managers’ index to a record low of 13.5 points in April. Anything below 50 points reflects a contraction in activity. This had reaffirmed the economic fallout from the virus, and eroded risk appetite, said Peregrine Treasury Solutions executive director Bianca Botes in a note. In morning trade on Friday the Shanghai Composite was down 0.62% while Japan’s Nikkei had fallen 0.74%. Tencent was down 0.63%. Naspers, Africa’s largest company by market capitalisation, is the biggest shareholder of the WeChat owner. Gold was down 0.39% to $1,739.29/oz while platinum was up 1.97% to $768.35. Brent crude was up 3.80% to $22.39 a barrel. The rand had firmed marginally to R19.079/$. There is little on the local economic calendar on Friday. Investment holding company Trematon Capital Investments is due to release its results for the half-year to end February later, and is expected to report a return to profit. gernetzkyk@businesslive.co.za
