Nesan Nair from Sasfin Securities chose Prosus​ as his stock pick of the day and independent analyst Chris Gilmour chose Cartrack. Nair said: “I’m going with Prosus, for me it’s just a phenominal business. They’re a full financial services business all on an app. It’s kind of an utopia of financial services. Prosus has a big discount to net asset value [NAV] and a good buy, given the growth opportunities in the financial services.” Gilmour said: “If you are looking for something that is a good little punt, you should look at Cartrack.”
