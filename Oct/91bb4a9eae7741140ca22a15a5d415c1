French broadcasting giant Group Canal+ has taken a 6.5% stake in MultiChoice, Africa’s largest pay-TV operator, whose share price was set for its best day in almost four months on Monday. The stake was worth R3.2bn on Monday morning, and MultiChoice’s share price was up 7.89% to R110.57 in early trade, on track for its best day since June 10. Canal+ is owned by Vivendi, which said in a statement the acquisition was a long-term financial investment, and demonstrated its confidence in the prospects of both MultiChoice and the African continent. The Canal+ group has more than 20.4-million subscribers worldwide, including 8.6-million in mainland France, the company said. MultiChoice has about 19.5-million subscribers in 50 countries. MultiChoice said its policy was not to comment on individual shareholders. “As a publicly held company, MultiChoice regularly engages with its strategic partners and maintains an open dialogue with the investment community,” the group said. MultiChoice’s share has fallen about 5% so far in 2020, but was on track for its ninth-consecutive session of gains on Monday, its longest streak since listing in February 2019.
