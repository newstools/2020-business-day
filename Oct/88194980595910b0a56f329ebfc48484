Nesi Chetty from Stanlib chose Fairvest Property as his stock pick of the day. “We’ve liked Fairvest Property for a while, it is one of the smaller property funds, it has a retail bias, specifically towards metropolitan and rural areas. They have a niche R3.5bn portfolio with very little vacancies. That end of the market is doing well.”
