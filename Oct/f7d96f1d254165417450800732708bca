SA’s Covid-19 response shows how the public and private health-care sectors can co-operate successfully. While we already have a state-owned health-care system, it lacks the leadership found in the private sector. This is a critical issue for proponents of the national health insurance (NHI) scheme, particularly when the cost of private medical aid excludes most South Africans from accessing health care. We must ask: has the public-private partnership during the Covid-19 pandemic laid the foundation for a successful NHI? Join the Business Day Dialogues, in partnership with Assegai Strategic Investments (ASI), as our panel of SA’s most respected medical aid and health economists discuss the future of health care in SA.
